Operations Research Project:

A group project to produce optimal trucking schedules to deliver stock to stores across Auckland for The Warehouse group.
These schedules included the closure of 1 of 2 warehouse distriution centres and seperate routes for weekend demands etc.
Data analysis and sampling was used to simulate variations in traffic and store demand for each proposed schedule.
This would test the commericial viability of each route and produce recommendations to the stakeholders.

Code produced solely by me is shown in this repository (main.py)
My involvement in other functiosn is not shown.
